Learning how different people think has always been fascinating to me and reading about fixed and growth mindsets was no exception. Ways of thinking and learning are so interesting because they help you understand yourself and also how people around you might perceive and interact with the world. Growth and fixed mindsets will view themselves and the people around them in different ways and in order to get along with other people and coexist, we need to understand what is going through other people’s minds.


People who have a growth mindset are people who believe that hard work and effort help them achieve a higher intelligence. They are more open to challenging themselves, accepting criticism, putting in effort, and also to finding ways around obstacles. But, people who have a fixed mindset believe that people are naturally intelligent and talented. They try to avoid challenges and criticism, and they typically give up in the face of obstacles and effort. Understanding that people identify with these different mindsets helps explore not only the thought process of other people but also of yourself. For myself, I believe that I consciously have a growth mindset, but that subconsciously, I probably have a bit of a fixed mindset as well. I don’t believe that people are born with intelligence and I do believe that intelligence comes with hard work, but I did identify with some of the feelings that fixed mindset people usually identify with like the imposter syndrome and thinking things like “I’m not a people person.”


After thinking about fixed and growth mindset in terms of myself, I turned my attention to how that relates to programming. I believe that programmers need to have a growth mindset. There will be many times when a solution might not be overly obvious and they will need to be able to work hard towards a solution instead of giving up because it’s too hard or they aren’t smart enough to figure it out like a fixed mindset person might. Programming requires the knowledge that you might not get to the answer right away and that’s ok, different people come up with ideas or spot mistakes differently but it doesn’t mean one person of the other is smarter, they’re just good at different things.


I don’t think that anyone has either only a growth or only a fixed mindset. There are so many different factors and components that make up one person, it’s unlikely that they always feel naturally confident or naturally unconfident in every different thing. I do believe, however, that it’s more important to have a growth mindset because it makes for a better, healthier person. A growth mindset won’t be overly obsessed with comparing themselves to other people and always doubting their worth like a fixed mindset person might and because of that, they will be more comfortable with themselves.
