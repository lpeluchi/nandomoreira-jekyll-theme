There are so many different devices that we all use everyday: computers, phones, tablets, and within those categories lay even more variety in devices. And, not only are people using all different devices, they’re also using different versions of software. Responsive design takes all of these differences into stride and provides the basis of the idea behind making websites work for all different platforms.

Responsive design has many different elements to it, but the basic idea is that with responsive design, websites will look and function great no matter what size window they’re being used on. The size of a screen is only one thing that programmers need to consider with responsive design. They also need to consider older browsers, the function of the website or it’s content, and whether it’s a website or a web application. 

There are many practices for responsive design and there are plenty more still being established. One of these is “start small,” meaning start with the smallest screen, usually a mobile device. But, with that, programmers have to be careful to not then neglect the larger screens that are still in use. One site recommended to start with the two ends of the screen and resolution possibilities and then start working on the more intermediate steps. This could mean for different sized browser windows on computers, or even to tablets and phones. Another popular recommendation is to “check content.” Make sure that what it on the different versions of a website needs to be there, or at least prioritize information differently on mobile websites versus desktop websites. One suggestion for a restaurant was for the directions to be more accessible on mobile in case the user is trying to get there. Along with this, be thoughtful about what needs to be on the page. Sometimes there’s no reason for a certain element to be present.

There’s also a certain design element that must be questioned for different formats of a website. Font, image size, input methods, navigation, and icons are all things that will show up differently with different sizes. Just because something works in one form doesn’t mean it will work with another form, but that also doesn’t make the previous version incorrect. There are just different priorities when using responsive design. The website also needs to be formatted differently for people using their fingers to navigate and for people filling in information of a website. There needs to be a certain amount of room for error in clicking, this forces the buttons and other features like navigation to have to be formatted a bit differently.

And finally, check the responsive design on actual devices with real people using it. The website should be utilizable for many different people using many different devices for it to be effective.
